## Keep Your Medi-Cal

Local Medi-Cal offices review each member's eligibility once a year or when they report changes to their household. Everyone's renewal date is different.

### Update my information

Example: My contact information has changed.

Visit BenefitsCal. Make sure we can reach you when it's your time to renew. Log into (or create) your account and update your address, phone number, email address. After you updaet your contact information, check your mailbox. If your local Medi-Cal office has all your information, they will mail you a letter saying your Medi-Cal was automatically renewed. If they don’t have all your information, they will mail you a large yellow envelope with a prepopulated renewal form.

### I got a renewal form

Example: I was mailed a yellow envelope with a Medi-Cal renewal form.

**Important!** Complete your renewal by the due date printed on the form. If you don’t, you could lose your Medi-Cal coverage.

#### Instructions

Before you begin, gather this information:

- Income, expenses, deductions
- Household details
- Address
- Supporting documents

During renewal:

1. Review and update your household information.
2. Review and update your income, expenses, and deductions information.

Asset information:
Current members of Medi-Cal do not need to report asset information to renew. They do not affect your eligibility. Assets are bank accounts, secondary homes, vehicles, and other financial resources.

#### Ways to renew your Medi-Cal

1. Online: Renew through BenefitsCal (However currently the BenefitsCal system is down due to ongoing technical issues)
2. Mail: Follow the instructions on your renewal form. Medi-Cal will pre-fill your form with any information we have on file. Update any information that is wrong or has changed. Make your updates right on the form. No need to complete or send proof of non-income assets or property such as bank statements and car registration. Remember to sign and date your form.
3. Phone: See Local County office
4. In Person: See Local County Office

### I'm no longer covered

Example: I got a letter saying I’m no longer eligible or my Medi-Cal has ended.

**Restart Your Coverage**

Didn't Turn in Your Renewal Form or Missing Information:
Your Medi-Cal coverage will end if you don't turn in your renewal form or you are missing proof of things like income that the county asked you to send. Your local Medi-Cal office will mail you a letter (Notice of Action) to let you know if you didn't turn in your renewal form or are missing information.

**Less than 90 days** - If it is less than 90 days from the date on the letter, send your local Medi-Cal county office the renewal form or missing information.

**More than 90 days** - If it is more than 90 days from the date on the letter, you must complete a new Medi-Cal application.

Assets when applying for Medi-Cal

- Assets will be asked for when applying for Medi-Cal
- The asset limit is S130,000 for one person
- Each additional household member adds $65,000 to the limit
- You can claim up to 10 members in a household
- Applications will not ask for asset information starting January 1, 2024

Over Income Limit:
You may be eligible for financial help for a private health plan through Covered California. If you qualify, your local Medi-Cal office will automatically send your information to Covered California. Covered California will enroll you in a quality plan that provides the best value at the lowest cost. Many Covered California enrollees pay $10 or less per month for health insurance, and some get covered at no cost. If you receive a notice asking to confirm your plan, respond right away. You will have the option to change your plan or opt-out. Visit CoveredCA.com to learn more.

Ended In Error:
If you think your Medi-Cal ended in error, you can contact your local Medi-Cal county office to review your case. If your local Medi-Cal office cannot help you, you can ask for a Medi-Cal Fair Hearing.

### I was renewed

Example: I got a letter saying my Medi-Cal coverage was renewed.
If your local Medi-Cal office has all of your information, they will mail you a letter saying your Medi-Cal coverage is renewed. You don't need to do anything.

You and your family can continue to use your Medi-Cal coverage for:

- Doctor visits
- Dental care
- Prescription drugs
- Mental health services
- Pediatric services
- In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS)
- And more

**Contact Information Changes**

It's really important that you let your local Medi-Cal office know of any big changes in your life. Changes such as how much money you make, if there is a new member in the household, someone leaves the house, or you move, you have 10 days to report that information to your local Medi-Cal office.

Update your contact information if it changes. Then your local Medi-Cal office can reach you when it's time to renew your coverage again next year.

## Medi-Cal Fair Hearing

If you have applied for, have received, or are currently receiving benefits/services from Medi-Cal AND you have a complaint about how your benefits/services are/were handled, or your services have been denied or modified, you may:

- Discuss your complaint with a representative of the County Welfare department in the county in which you live (or where you lived when you received the benefits/services).
- File a discrimination complaint - see the information under Non-Discrimination Policy and Language Access.
- Request a hearing - see the information under How to File a Hearing Request.

You must ﬁle your request within 90 days of receiving the Notice of Action (NOA). You may be able to file after 90 days if you have a good reason, like illness or a disability.

- ​DHCS received section 1902(e)(14)(A) of the Social Security Act approval to temporarily extend​ the timeframe permitted for Medi-Cal members to request an eligibility-related fair hearing to 120 days from the date the notice of action is mailed. The temporary extension for Medi-Cal members to request a fair hearing is effective April 1, 2023 and remains effective until September 30, 2024. This extended time frame only includes eligibility-related fair hearing requests, including terminations of Medicaid eligibility, reductions in scope of benefits (from full Medi-Cal benefits to limited Medi-Cal benefits), and increases in beneficiary liability or share-of-cost.

​Your beneﬁts will continue pending review (Aid Paid Pending) if the hearing is ﬁled within 10 days of receiving the NOA. This process allows you to continue receiving services while the case is being reviewed.
